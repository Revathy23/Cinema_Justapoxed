Cine Hunt is a full stack website exclusively to watch various movies . It is developed using Bootstrap 4 and php with mysql database.

It is a complete dymanic website all the images and content other than the index page are dynamically uploaded from the database..

The index page consist of two categories .. Tamil and English. In tamil category It is seperated based on years..The entire data from the tamil.php is uploaded from the database..

The movies are sorted based on the actors hence we can search various movies based on the actor of user choice..

Every time randomly a movie will be available to watch online
Hence retrieving random samples from the table and printing in the screen.

The final request session in which user can request for movies of their to add to the website.. Thus this data is stored to the table..which can be later viewed by developer in the database..

***Thus all the five points for backend judging criteria are satisfied***

Since this is a dynamic site. I can't host it in git pages .. Hence I have hosted it in my own domain

https://gouty-hickories.000webhostapp.com/index.php

Since it is a free domain. The load time of the website will be little slow.. Please bare with it..

Please take a look at it.. And my sql file is around 15 mb and I am trying to upload it in github due to poor network I cant upload .. Will upload asap.
